An assignment for my Computer Vision class! We were tasked to create the following algorithms from scratch:

**Hough Lines:** Draws lines where edges are detected

**Harris Corner Detection:** Detects corners and features of an image

**SIFT:** Scale Invariance Feature Transform detects feature matches using 2 images. Matching is currently not accurate, however it does calculate feature descriptors properly.

**Keys:** Press Esc to close all windows
